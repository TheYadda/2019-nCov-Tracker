# ⚠️ NO LONGER MAINTAINED ⚠️
If you can fix the bot and get it running again, I will gladly welcome a pull request, but I just do not have the cognitive bandwidth between finals, the protests, and my upcoming internship to maintain the bot now that it no longer seems to work. I apologize.

# COVID-19 Tracker v10.7b
Bot for posting information on spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) to Twitter and Discord. The official instance of this bot can be found at [@COVID19Tracker](https://twitter.com/COVID19Tracker).

# To create your own instance:

1. Sign up for Twitter API access [here](https://developer.twitter.com/) and make note of your consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret. _TWITTER WILL ONLY SHOW YOU YOUR ACCESS TOKEN AND ACCESS TOKEN SECRET **ONCE,** SO DON'T LOSE THEM._ **DO NOT SHARE THESE WITH ANYONE OR THEY CAN TAKE OVER YOUR TWITTER ACCOUNT.** If you are using a second account for verbose output, do the same with that account as well.

2. Make a `credentials.py` file in the following format:

```
import tweepy

consumer_key = ''
consumer_secret = ''
access_token = ''
access_token_secret = ''
```

3. Run `Setup-nCoV.sh`. This will create your Python 3 virtual environment, install all required packages, create the launcher scripts to run the program without having to activate the virtual environment, create the cron job for the bot to run automatically, and test the script for you in notweet mode.

4. Create your `config.txt` file, using config_example.txt as a base. The config file requires 9 entries to function correctly, in the following format:

```
[FLAG EMOJI]
[DICTIONARY KEY FOR DESIRED COUNTRY]
[OUTPUT NAME FOR COUNTRY]
[MINIMUM NUMBER OF DAYS TO CLIP OFF OF LEFT SIDE OF GRAPH]
[FILTER LIST] (comma-separated keylist if a 'country' is made up of multiple countries - NOT FOR 'World')
0
0
0
```

I advise you put the `World` key in there somewhere, for obvious reasons.

5. This bot can also post to Discord. In your Discord server settings, generate webhooks for whatever channels you want the bot to post in, and place each webhook URL on its own line in a `webhooks.txt` file.

Please note the bot will automatically overwrite your Twitter bio with a 'last updated' statistic. If you have a bio you want to use in addition to this, please create 'bio_top.txt' and 'bio_bottom.txt' files containing your desired information. The last updated count will appear between the text contained in these two files, both of which are optional.

You're done! The bot should now be working.

# About
Cases, dead, and recovered counts are from the [Johns Hopkins University CSSE tracker](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).'

This link leads to dashboards with visual maps as well as per-state statistics, in English, and sources information from the [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports), [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases), [NHC](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/list_gzbd.shtml), [DXY](https://ncov.dxy.cn/ncovh5/view/pneumonia?scene=2&clicktime=1579582238&enterid=1579582238&from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0), [1Point3Acres](https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/), [worldometers.info](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), [BNO News](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/04/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/), and [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data). It appears to be updated by hand, and thus are not 'up-to-the-minute'.

Active cases count is derived by the following formula: (cases - dead - recovered = active)

Updates are time-and-datestamped based on time of data being fetched and posted. Time-and-datestamp does NOT refer to when the information was last updated. For that, see the links above.

Tweets are in the following format:

```
🕓MM/DD ##H #COVID19 #Coronavirus

🏳️😷X,XXX,XXX 🏥X,XXX,XXX 💀XXX,XXX 👍XXX,XXX
🏳️😷XXX,XXX 🏥XXX,XXX 💀XX,XXX 👍XXX,XXX

😷Total 🏥Active 💀Dead 👍Recovered

This bot also optionally can output to Discord in the form of embeds in webhook messages. Discord embeds are in the following format:

```

🕓 Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC
```

In both cases, updates will contain graphs showing up to the last approximately 11 weeks of confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, and recoveries in your chosen countries, with a monimum bound of days set by your config file.

This bot will, if functioning normally, check for new data once every two hours, and only post when there is new data. If any problems arise, please report them to @Ellie the Tinkerer#7777 on Discord.
